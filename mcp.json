If any is unavailable, mark UNCERTAIN and give the shortest verification path.\n- Use MCP tools deliberately: duckduckgo for niche/up-to-date facts; github-mcp-custom for repo search/PR context; playwright for E2E; grafana for metrics/logs; neo4j-memory-server for lessons learned/how-to.\n- Never claim something exists/works/is configured without citing exact file paths and (when critical) small snippets.\n- Destructive ops (migrations/deletes/mass refactors/force push/infra/major deps): show rollback + exact commands, then stop for explicit user confirmation.\n- Output: concise, decision-oriented; include 1 key risk/failure mode and 1 invalidating assumption when relevant.\n",
        "MCP_PROMPT_INIT_PROJECT_RULES_APPEND": "\n\n# Project Rules (agent-usable)\nCreate rules optimized for agents (short, testable, repo-grounded). Prefer: coding standards, repo conventions, commands to verify, definition-of-done, and where-to-find-what. Avoid long prose; include paths and canonical docs locations.\nAlso propose 3–7 candidate “memories” (how-to/lessons/where-to-find) and ask the user to approve saving to neo4j memory.\n",
        "MCP_PROMPT_PLAN_TASK_APPEND": "\n\n# Planning Requirements\nBefore planning: (1) listTasks/queryTask to avoid duplicates; (2) check neo4j memory for prior patterns/constraints; (3) read repo entrypoints relevant to the task.\nPlan must include: scope + non-goals; files to touch; step-by-step checkpoints; acceptance criteria; explicit verification commands; risks + rollback; and dependencies. Produce tasks small enough to execute and verify deterministically.\nIf research is needed, call it out explicitly and use duckduckgo MCP; do not guess.\n",
        "MCP_PROMPT_ANALYZE_TASK_APPEND": "\n\n# Analysis Requirements\nProvide 2–3 viable approaches with trade-offs (correctness, maintainability, security, complexity). Identify unknowns and propose the fastest validation (tiny repro, grep, minimal test, targeted doc/source).\nSecurity-by-design: note authn/authz, input validation, secrets handling, and logging.\nWhen facts may be time-sensitive or niche, verify via duckduckgo MCP and cite what changed.\n",
        "MCP_PROMPT_SPLIT_TASKS_APPEND": "\n\n# Task Decomposition Rules\nSplit into atomic tasks with: objective, exact outputs (files/changes), preconditions, and verification commands. Keep each task executable end-to-end without hidden dependencies.\nEnsure ordering/dep graph is explicit. Prefer fewer, clearer tasks over many micro-tasks.\n",
        "MCP_PROMPT_EXECUTE_TASK_APPEND": "\n\n# Execution Rules\nExecute exactly one task at a time unless the user explicitly requests continuous execution.\nBefore edits: read relevant files; do not invent APIs. During execution: implement + verify locally (or provide exact commands) + update canonical docs + remove temp artifacts.\nIf UI/E2E relevant, use playwright. If runtime/ops signals matter, use grafana to validate metrics/logs.\nIf blocked (secrets/access/CI), stop at the smallest blocker and propose the fastest unblock path.\n",
        "MCP_PROMPT_VERIFY_TASK_APPEND": "\n\n# Verification Bar\nVerification must be explicit: commands (lint/typecheck/tests/build) and expected signals.

Only save if user approves.\n",
