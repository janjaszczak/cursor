# Security Rules

## KeePassXC Integration Architecture

- **Keyring storage** (PowerShell SecretManagement/secret-tool): Stores **ONLY** the KeePassXC database password
- **KeePassXC database**: Stores **EXCLUSIVELY** all actual secrets (passwords, tokens, API keys, SSH keys)
- **No file-based fallbacks**: All password storage uses secure keyring mechanisms only

**Verification**: Before implementing KeePassXC features, verify "what goes where" - keyring = database password only, KeePassXC = all secrets.
