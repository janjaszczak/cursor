Available MCP servers and how to use them

- memory: long-term project memory stored in Neo4j.
  Use this server to store and retrieve stable project knowledge (architecture, domain concepts, environment definitions, standard commands).
  Do not store passwords, API keys, tokens, or other secrets here.

- duckduckgo: external web search.
  Use this when you need up-to-date or external information that is not in the repo, docs, or memory.

- github: access to GitHub repositories.
  Use this to inspect and modify remote repositories only when I explicitly ask.
  Never perform destructive operations (force pushes, branch deletes, tag deletes, mass file deletions) without my explicit confirmation.

- playwright: browser automation and web page interaction.
  Use this for end-to-end flows, scraping where allowed, and validating UI flows, instead of guessing page structure.

- grafana: metrics and dashboards.
  Use this server to query metrics, logs, and dashboards for debugging and performance investigations.
  Treat all operations as read-only unless I explicitly approve a write/change operation.

General policy
- Prefer using these MCP tools instead of “simulating” their behavior in plain code or guesses.
- Before using a tool that can change external state (GitHub, any write-capable server), explain what you plan to do and ask for confirmation.
- Never expose or log secrets or sensitive data returned by MCP tools in your explanations.
