# troubleshooting-rca

## Activation gate (anti-noise)
Activate when:
- There is an error message, failing test, crash, regression, unexpected behavior, or logs.

Skip when:
- User requests implementation from scratch and no failure exists yet.

## Procedure
1. Restate symptom + expected behavior.
2. Collect minimal repro:
   - Command, input, environment, last known good commit.
3. Hypotheses (max 3) ranked by likelihood.
4. Test each hypothesis with the smallest possible check.
5. Fix + verify with test/run.
6. Add a prevention note (test, guard, logging).

## Output
- Symptom → Most likely cause → Fix → Verification command(s).
