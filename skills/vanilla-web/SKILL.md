# Vanilla Web (HTML/CSS/JS)

## Baseline constraints (from the rule)
Use these as non-negotiables:
- "HTML/CSS/JS only (no framework)."
- "Keep JS modular (ESM), split responsibilities (SRP)."
- "Prefer small, focused functions and pure utilities; avoid global state."
- "Ship complete runnable files and minimal tests before marking done."

## When to activate this skill
Activate when the user asks for:
- vanilla JS / plain HTML/CSS/JS / static page
- “no framework”, “no React/Vue/Angular”
- small UI components (modal, tabs, dropdown, form validation) built directly in the DOM
- refactors to remove framework dependencies or reduce JS complexity

## Output expectations
1) Deliver **complete runnable** files (no missing imports/paths, no TODO placeholders).
2) Keep changes **small, testable, and incremental**.
3) Provide a short **runbook**: how to run/verify locally + what to check in DevTools.

## Implementation workflow
### 1) Clarify only what blocks correctness
Ask up to 3 questions *only* if requirements are ambiguous in a way that changes implementation.
Otherwise proceed with explicit assumptions.

### 2) Structure & responsibilities
- Prefer this split:
  - `index.html` (semantic markup)
  - `styles.css` (or `css/…`)
  - `js/main.js` as an ESM entrypoint + `js/modules/*.js` for components/utilities
- SRP: each module does one thing (DOM wiring, state, rendering, API, utilities).
- Avoid global mutable state. If state is needed, encapsulate it in a module and expose minimal functions.

### 3) HTML guidelines
- Use semantic tags (`header`, `main`, `nav`, `button`, `dialog` where applicable).
- Accessibility baseline: keyboard navigation, focus states, ARIA only when needed (don’t ARIA-overuse).

### 4) CSS guidelines
- Prefer simple, predictable naming (BEM-like optional).
- Use CSS variables for theme primitives.
- Keep layout responsive by default (flex/grid + relative units).

### 5) JavaScript guidelines (ESM)
- Use `type="module"` and explicit imports/exports.
- Prefer pure utilities and small functions.
- Use event delegation for lists/dynamic UIs.
- Handle errors explicitly (network failures, missing DOM nodes, invalid inputs).

## Verification checklist
Use the detailed checklist in:
- `references/checklist.md`

When finishing work, ensure:
- No console errors/warnings caused by the change
- All referenced assets resolve (paths/imports)
- Feature works with keyboard and without requiring a framework runtime

## Progressive disclosure
Keep this SKILL.md lean; store deeper examples and checklists under `references/`.
Do not paste large style guides into SKILL.md—link to repo examples instead.

## Suggested companion scripts (optional)
- `scripts/serve.sh` for quick static serving (manual verification)
